Features of the project :-

i) Third eye for the blind:- This solution will help the visually impaired person to detect obstacles in the way. This feature will notify the user  depending upon the distance between user and obstacle.

ii) Automated street lights:- We will try to build street lights which will get automatically turned on at the night time or specifically in the cloudy weather and automatically turned off in the day time
