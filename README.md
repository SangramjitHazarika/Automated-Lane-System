Features of the project :-

• Third eye for the blind:- This solution will help the visually impaired person to detect obstacles in the way. This feature will notify the user depending upon the distance between user and obstacle.

• Automated street lights:- We will try to build street lights which will get automatically turned on at the night time or specifically in the cloudy weather and automatically turned off in the day time
